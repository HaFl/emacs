# This is a Clojure-Friendly Emacs Config

The basic version of the config can be found in
[this entertaining Clojure tutorial](http://www.braveclojure.com/basic-emacs/).

Based thereon, I added some modifications (e.g.
[emacs-powerline](https://github.com/jonathanchu/emacs-powerline)) to improve
my personal emacs experience.

Currently, this really is just a first stab while trying to get more familiar
with emacs.
